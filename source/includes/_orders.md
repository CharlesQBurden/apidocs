# Place an order

## Create an order

Zinc offers the underlying API for apps that need real-time order placing capabilities. With a single POST request, you can order an item from one of our supported retailers. Making an order request will start an order. You'll receive a `request_id` in the POST body's response which you'll then use for [retrieving the status of the order](#retrieving-an-order).

--------- | ---- | -----------
gift_message | String | A message to include on the packing slip for the recipient. Must be no more than 240 characters, or 9 lines.

## Retrieving an order

> Example retrieve an order request

```shell
curl "https://api.zinc.io/v1/orders/3f1c939065cf58e7b9f0aea70640dffc" \
  -u <client_token>:
```

To see the status of an order, you can retrieve it using the request id you obtained from your order request, and placing it in a GET request URL. Orders usually take a while to process. While your order is processing, the response will return an error with code type `request_processing`.

> Example retrieve an order response (request processing)

```shell
{
  "_type": "error",
  "code": "request_processing",
  "message": "Request is currently processing and will complete soon.",
  "data": {}
}
```

> Example retrieve an order response (order response)

```shell
{
  "_type" : "order_response",
  "price_components" : {
    "shipping" : 0,
    "subtotal" : 1999,
    "tax" : 0,
    "total" : 1999
  },
  "merchant_order_ids" : [
    {
      "merchant_order_id" : "112-1234567-7272727",
      "merchant" : "amazon",
      "account" : "timbeaver@gmail.com",
      "placed_at" : "2014-07-02T23:51:08.366Z"
    }
  ],
  "tracking" : [
    {
      "product_id" : "0923568964",
      "merchant_order_id" : "112-1234567-7272727",
      "carrier" : "Fedex",
      "tracking_number" : "9261290100129790891234",
      "obtained_at" : "2014-07-03T23:22:48.165Z"
    }
  ],
  "request" : {
    ...
  }
}
```

Once the request completes, the retrieve an order response should either return a response of type `order_response` or `error`. An error response body will contain a `code` and a `message`. The code indicates the error that occurred, while the message provides a more detailed description of the error. Any extra details about the error will be provided in the `data` object. For a full list of errors, see the [Errors section](#errors).

### Order response attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
price_components | Object | A [price components object](#price-components-object) which contains details about the price of the final order
merchant_order_ids | Array | A [merchant order ids object](#merchant-order-ids-object) which contains details about the retailer's order identifiers
tracking | Array | An array of [tracking objects](#tracking-object) that contain the order's tracking information. In most cases, this field will not be populated immediately after the order is placed and will only be available later after tracking is updated by the retailer. Once tracking has been obtained, a POST request will be sent to the `tracking_obtained` field of the [webhooks object](#webhooks-object) from the request if set.
request | Object | The original request that was sent to the Zinc API

## Selecting shipping

Ordering on the Zinc API can be complicated due to all the potential shipping options available. Generally, faster shipping will cost more money, so you must decide how fast you'd like your items or how much money to pay for shipping. Zinc provides a number of options to customize your shipping speed and cost formulas.

Since different items will have different shipping options, you can use a product's [seller selection criteria](#seller-selection-criteria) to specify `handling_days_max`. This will filter the list of potential offers down to those that will arrive within a certain number of days. The Zinc API will then select the cheapest offer that matched all of your seller selection criteria to make a purchase. For example, if you specified `"handling_days_max": 6`, then any offer whose latest delivery date is greater than 6 days from now would be excluded from your buying selection. Thus, if two sellers are offering the same product, but one has a guaranteed delivery date 10 days away and the other seller has a guaranteed delivery date 5 days away, the second seller's offer would be selected.

You may also use the [shipping parameter](#shipping-object) on an order to select a shipping option once a product has been selected. Instead of filtering by the different offers, like the seller selection criteria, the `shipping` parameter will choose the shipping speed on the selected offer. For example, if you set `"max_days": 5` on the `shipping` parameter, the Zinc API would attempt to select the cheapest shipping method that took less than 5 days. Thus, if there was a shipping method that took 3 days and cost $10 and another shipping method that took 7 days but cost $2, the first shipping option would be selected.

## Order bundling

The bundling feature groups orders together before placing them. This is often advantageous on retailers where larger orders are given free shipping. To use bundling, you only need to specify `bundled: true` when placing an order request. Bundling currently only works on the following retailers: `amazon`, `amazon_uk`.

The bundling feature allows you to take advantage of free shipping over $50 (on Amazon) without having to change your Zinc integration. Bundling will take the shipping addresses, products, and quantities from separate orders and will group them together into a single order, making sure that each product is routed correctly. The order requests and responses remain exactly the same. The only difference is when the order is placed. The order bundling feature will wait for enough orders in the queue before launching a bundled order. The exact dynamics are as follows:

1. The order bundler will wait until $55 in products have been purchased. As soon as more than $55 of products have been queued with `bundled: true`, the bundler will launch a new order.
2. If the order bundler has waited for longer than 6 hours and has not yet obtained $55 in products, it will launch an order with whatever products are currently in the queue.

Note that the order bundler will not group together two orders which have the same product ids.

## Amazon Email Verification

Amazon occasionally requires additional verification of account ownership by
emailing you a code to enter during login. If this happens during an order, you
will receive an `account_locked_verification_required` error. In this case,
please check the email associated with the account and obtain the verification
code. Then resubmit your order and supply the code as `verification_code` under
the `retailer_credentials` object.
